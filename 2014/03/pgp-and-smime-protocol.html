                                    Both PGP and S/MIME protocols are used for authentication and privacy of messages
                                    over internet.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    S/MIME protocol refers to Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions which has
                                    been incorporated in the various main exchange software, incl. Outlook, Thunderbird
                                    & others And also incorporated in all major browsers (chrome, Mozilla, IE and
                                    others). S/MIME is based on IETF standards and defined in RFC 5751.
                                </p>
                                <p> RFC 5751 defined S/MIME as "S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
                                    provides a consistent way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the popular
                                    Internet MIME standard, S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security
                                    services for electronic messaging applications: authentication, message integrity
                                    and non-repudiation of origin (using digital signatures), and data confidentiality
                                    (using encryption). As a supplementary service, S/MIME provides for message
                                    compression."</p>
                                <p>PGP known as Pretty Good Privacy, is a data encryption and decryption computer
                                    program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data
                                    communication. PGP is often used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts,
                                    e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security
                                    of e-mail communications. It was created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.</p>
                                <p>PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and
                                    decrypting data.</p>
                                <p>PGP user has the ability to give its public key to another user directly or the user
                                    can obtain the public key from the first user. PGP does not mandate a policy for
                                    creating trust and hence each user is free to decide the length of trust in the
                                    received keys. With the S/MIME, the sender or receiver does not rely on exchanging
                                    keys in advance and share a common certifier on which both can rely.</p>
                                <p>
                                    S/MIME is considered superior to PGP from an administrative perspective because of
                                    its strength, support for centralized key management through X.509 certificate
                                    servers and extensive industry support. PGP is more complicated from an end-user
                                    perspective, because it requires additional plug-ins or downloads to operate. S/MIME
                                    protocol allows most vendors to send and receive encrypted email without using
                                    additional software.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    S/MIME is convenient because of secure transformation of all applications like
                                    spreadsheets, graphics, presentations, movies etc., but PGP was originated to
                                    address the security concerns of plain e-mail or text messages.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    S/MIME is derived from the PKCS #7 data format for the messages, and the X.509v3
                                    format for certificates. PGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data
                                    compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and public-key cryptography.
